                Text="You only need a few basic staple ingredients for this cheesecake recipe.&#10;
Block cream cheese: Four 8-ounce blocks&#10; of full-fat cream cheese are the base of this cheesecake.&#10; That's 2 pounds. Make sure you're buying the blocks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread. There's no diets allowed in &#10;cheesecake, so don't pick up the reduced fat variety!
Sugar: 1 cup. Not that much considering&#10; how many mouths you can feed with this dessert. Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. Using only 1 cup of sugar gives this cheesecake the opportunity to balance tangy and sweet, &#10;just as classic cheesecake should taste.
Sour cream: 1 cup. I recently tested a &#10;cheesecake recipe with 1 cup of heavy cream instead, but&#10; ended up sticking with my original (which can be found here with blueberry swirls!). I was curious about the heavy cream addition and figured it would yield a softer cheesecake bite. The cheesecake was soft, but lacked the stability and richness I wanted. It was almost too creamy. Sour cream is most definitely the right choice.
A little flavor: 1 teaspoon of pure &#10;vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice. The lemon juice brightens up the &#10;cheesecake's overall flavor and vanilla is always a good idea.
Eggs: 3 eggs are the final ingredient. &#10;You'll beat the eggs in last, one at a time, until they are *just* &#10;incorporated. Do not overmix the batter once the eggs are added. This will whip air into the cheesecake batter, resulting in &#10;cheesecake cracking and deflating.
